### Abstract:
This study explores road traffic accidents using exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends. The analysis focuses on accidents in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, revealing that most accidents occur during post-work hours, indicating a need for specific traffic control measures. By leveraging data mining techniques, this research identifies critical factors contributing to accidents, helping policymakers design interventions to reduce accident rates and improve road safety.

### Key Insights:

- Nighttime accidents spike during weekends (12-3 AM).
- Higher accident rates on two-way roads with broken lines compared to solid-lined roads.
- Public transportation vehicles have higher accident rates than larger trucks.
- The study emphasizes the importance of specific road safety measures based on accident trends.
